                        <p>
                            Our projects are qualified for USCIS administered EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. Congress created the EB-5 Program in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1992, Congress created the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as the Regional Center Program. This sets aside EB-5 visas for participants who invest in commercial enterprises associated with regional centers approved by USCIS based on proposals for promoting economic growth. Foreign investors may invest in our projects to obtain EB-5 visa. Our projects are sponsored by USCIS approved Regional Centers, therefore prospective immigrant investor may invest $500,000 in our projects and obtain U.S. residency. If qualified, EB-5 visa is granted to immigrant investor in addition to his/her unmarried children under the age of 21.
